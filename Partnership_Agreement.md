## **4. Future Goals & Expectations**

Big Bond aims to:

Partner payouts require majority approval.

No partner is guaranteed payout if funds are needed for operations.

## **7. MVP & Bonus Awards**

Partners may approve financial bonuses for individuals who go above and
beyond (“MVPs”) per event.

These awards must be agreed upon before or after an event and
documented.

## **8. Graphic Design Scope & Pay**

The graphic designer’s standard scope includes event branding and core
marketing assets.

Additional requests beyond this scope (extra revisions, custom
animations, merch design, etc.) will be compensated at an agreed rate or
flat bonus per event.

## **9. Voting; Allocation of Votes; Approval Thresholds**

### 9.1 Voting Power

All matters submitted to the Members for approval shall be decided by a vote of the Members holding a majority of the total voting shares, unless a greater threshold is expressly required under this Agreement.

Voting shares shall be allocated in proportion to each Member’s Percentage Interest, as follows:

- **Mad People LLC** – 20 votes  
- **Lucid LLC** – 20 votes  
- **No Ceilings No Floors LLC** – 60 votes  

A total of 100 votes shall be deemed outstanding.

### 9.2 Allocation and Splitting of Votes by a Member

Each Member shall have the right to allocate and cast its voting shares in whole or in part as it determines.

A Member may split its voting shares among multiple positions on any matter. The Company shall recognize fractional or split voting by a Member, and votes shall be counted according to the number of voting shares actually cast in favor of or against a proposal.

For example, if No Ceilings No Floors LLC elects to cast 20 of its 60 votes in favor of a matter and 40 votes against, the partnership shall recognize such allocation, and the votes shall be counted accordingly.

- Merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all Company assets  
- Dissolution of the Partnership or the Big Bond project.  
- Incurrence of investment capital in excess of $3000

- Any change to the Percentage Interests of the Members (voting or ownership)
- Any action that disproportionately affects the rights of a specific Member relative to the others  
- Any request for members to contribute additional funds which are not expressly contemplated in an approved budget
