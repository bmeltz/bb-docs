majority of partners.

A **Budget Committee** may be formed consisting of at least 2 partners.

Formal budget/planning meetings will occur at key milestones (booking,
marketing launch, final production phase).

## **4. Future Goals & Expectations**

Big Bond aims to:

- Sell out attendance

- Improve experience and production quality

- Improve artist and vendor pay

- Build long-term brand value

- Operate sustainably without unpaid labor expectations

All partners are expected to contribute time, skills, or resources
toward these goals.

## **5. Increasing Artist & Vendor Pay**

As revenue increases, a defined percentage of additional profit will be
allocated to improving artist and vendor compensation before increasing
partner payouts, when financially feasible.

## **6. Profit Use & Partner Payouts**

After expenses and debt repayment, profits may be:

- Reinvested into the next event

- Held as reserves

- Distributed to partners based on ownership %

Partner payouts require majority approval.

No partner is guaranteed payout if funds are needed for operations.

## **7. MVP & Bonus Awards**

Partners may approve financial bonuses for individuals who go above and
beyond (“MVPs”) per event.

These awards must be agreed upon before or after an event and
documented.

## **8. Graphic Design Scope & Pay**

The graphic designer’s standard scope includes event branding and core
marketing assets.

Additional requests beyond this scope (extra revisions, custom
animations, merch design, etc.) will be compensated at an agreed rate or
